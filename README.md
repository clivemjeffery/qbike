ANT+ Cycling Training on Raspberry Pi.

This is a simple hobby project using python, inspired and kickstarted by
* http://www.johannesbader.ch/2014/06/track-your-heartrate-on-raspberry-pi-with-ant/

It requires the following useful libraries:
* python-ant
* PyQt4
* pyqtgraph

[This video](http://youtu.be/lVoNQ8jtVbI) shows it working.

I'm working on documentation of the setup steps and extending the project to read speed and cadence data.
